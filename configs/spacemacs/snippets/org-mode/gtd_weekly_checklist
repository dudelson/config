* weekly planning
** Phase 1: Collect/Capture
- [ ] empty your mind
- [ ] one touch to inbox zero
- [ ] collect all loose papers. For each, decide whether to leave/file/recycle it.
- [ ] process thought dumps. For each thought dump, decide whether to:
    - do it now (if it would take less than two minutes),
    - delete it, or
    - turn it into a project, either ongoing or in notnow.org
- [ ] organize browser tabs (mobile and desktop)
- [ ] clear home directory
- [ ] clear notes.md
- [ ] grep for and resolve sync conflicts in gtd and pkb files
        => run shell alias ~find-sync-conflicts~
- [ ] move signal backup to laptop (via adb)
** Phase 2: Clarify
- [ ] check calendar *and org agenda* (-2/+4 weeks).
- [ ] review undone tasks from previous week. Refile all the ones that you
  don't want to continue with in the coming week. The rest will be moved
  in the next step.
- [ ] check off habits
- [ ] check off completed tasks from today
** Phase 3: Commit
- [ ] make new heading for upcoming week
- [ ] transfer remaining tasks from previous week to upcoming week and
  schedule them
- [ ] review captured todos. Schedule or refile each one.
- [ ] review "waiting" todo items and see if I need to follow up on any of them
- [ ] choose any projects from notnow.org that you would like to start this
  week and schedule them
- [ ] git commit
- [ ] check news
