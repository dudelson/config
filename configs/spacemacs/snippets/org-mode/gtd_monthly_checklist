* monthly review
** pre-review housekeeping
- [ ] move current.org to archives/ and re-create fresh copy from template
- [ ] move todos from old file to new file
- [ ] *complete phase 1 of the weekly review*
** review and update horizons of focus
Remember: goals and areas are never "done", so I don't have to worry about what
"done" looks like! The expectation is that I update my areas and goals such that
they continue to be "good enough", since good enough is really frickin' good!
*** backprop
- [ ] backpropagate projects and habits to areas, then goals
    => this is so that my higher horizons of focus stay in sync with my true
       intentions and priorities, which are reflected by what I'm actually working
       on right now
*** update goals list
- [ ] review goals list and ask: Are the goals I'm currently working towards in
      line with my true intentions and priorities?
- [ ] adjust goal deadlines as needed
*** update areas
- [ ] review areas list and ask:
        - Do I need any new areas?
        - Are there any areas I can combine?
        - Any I can deprecate?
        - Am I starting any new habits this month?
- [ ] replicate updated areas list across "2 Areas" folder and someday+maybe.org
    => Need all areas to be represented in areas folder even if those folders are empty
       BC sometimes I can't find a place for a note BC I forget that an appropriate
       area exists
*** update project list
- [ ] skim someday+maybe.org for tasks to move to either notnow.org or current.org
- [ ] review projects list and ask:
        - Do I feel connected to my project list and sensitive to its contents?
        - Do I have a clear sense of priorities?
*** repeat if necessary
- [ ] if necessary, repeat the above steps until I feel that all of my horizons
      of focus are aligned with each other and with my true intentions and
      priorities
** post-review housekeeping
- [ ] complete phases 2 and 3 of the weekly review
- [ ] manually add new file to git and commit
- [ ] manually check git for PKB and add new files
- [ ] clean up ~/s/misc/sync
