* monthly rotation
- [ ] do weekly planning
- [ ] clean up ~/s/misc/sync
- [ ] commit changes to dotfiles
- [ ] copy thoughts/notes worth keeping into pkb
    - to prevent unnecessary clutter via duplication, each thought or note should be
      inserted into the PKB exactly one
    - remove the timestamp
    - add a unicode check mark (âœ“) if the note was imported into the PKB
    - add a unicode triangle (ðŸ›†) if the note was not imported into the PKB because
      you didn't know where to put it (i.e. notes marked with a triangle should be
      revisited later)
    - unmarked thoughts/notes will be assumed to be marked for /non-insertion/; i.e.
      it was presumably decided that the note was not important enough to be
      transferred.
- [ ] create dates/ file for new month
- [ ] move todos from old file to new file
- [ ] move current.org symlink to point to new file
- [ ] skim someday+maybe.org for tasks to move to either notnow.org or current.org
- [ ] manually add new file to git and commit
- [ ] manually check git for PKB and add new files
