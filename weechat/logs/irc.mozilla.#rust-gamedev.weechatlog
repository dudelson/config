2015-05-29 19:02:23	@cmr	I'd just draw quads and draw the grid on top though
2015-05-29 19:02:37	bur_sangjun	so GL_QUADS, where in the image above, I'd put V2 in the same place as V5 and V3 in the same place as V4?
2015-05-29 19:02:45	@cmr	no, not GL_QUADS.
2015-05-29 19:02:47	@cmr	Using triangles.
2015-05-29 19:02:53	bur_sangjun	is there a specific reason?
2015-05-29 19:03:03	bur_sangjun	if quads are supplied natively
2015-05-29 19:03:03	@cmr	quads are deprecated and not supported in GL ES
2015-05-29 19:03:06	@cmr	they aren't.
2015-05-29 19:03:08	bur_sangjun	ah
2015-05-29 19:03:16	@cmr	the driver just converts them under the hood.
2015-05-29 19:03:27	bur_sangjun	so, how would I go about rendering one texture say 100x100, distored to fit to a quad then?
2015-05-29 19:03:35	bur_sangjun	if I'm making it out of two triangles
2015-05-29 19:03:56	@cmr	you don't need to distort anything, you can just place a regular grid and an ortho camera at an angle.
2015-05-29 19:04:36	@cmr	You may find https://open.gl/ useful.
2015-05-29 19:04:50	bur_sangjun	wouldn't doing that distort the view though
2015-05-29 19:04:57	bur_sangjun	as in, it would have an FOV, whereas isometric perspective doesn't
2015-05-29 19:05:09	bur_sangjun	it's a striaght perspective as it were
2015-05-29 19:05:41	@cmr	ortho cameras do not have an FOV.
2015-05-29 19:05:45	@cmr	per se

2015-05-30 21:29:58	HeroesGrave	Serialisation for plain-old-data (no pointers), or containers thereof.

2015-05-31 13:18:08	tomaka	meh: pong
2015-05-31 13:18:50	meh	tomaka, cpal, how does the append_data business work exactly? let's say I have a frame with 4096 bytes of data, how should I handle it?
2015-05-31 13:19:06	tomaka	you call append_data(4096)
2015-05-31 13:19:14	tomaka	it returns a Buffer which derefs to a slice
2015-05-31 13:19:20	tomaka	and you write that data to the slice
2015-05-31 13:19:26	tomaka	no, wait
2015-05-31 13:19:38	tomaka	the value passed to append_data is not the size in bytes
2015-05-31 13:19:53	tomaka	but the number of elements in the returned buffer
2015-05-31 13:20:08	tomaka	so if you have a bunch of u16, you'd pass 2048
2015-05-31 13:20:39	meh	tomaka, do I need to wait for the voice to play it all or can I call append_data multiple times and just feed it what I have and it will handle it internally?
2015-05-31 13:20:51	meh	also how do I handle the case where the buffer is smaller than max_elements?
2015-05-31 13:21:07	tomaka	meh: that's precisely the trick
2015-05-31 13:21:21	tomaka	if the backend can't handle all the data, the returned Buffer will be smaller
2015-05-31 13:21:37	meh	and that's when I know to wait
2015-05-31 13:21:40	tomaka	yeah
2015-05-31 13:21:42	meh	cool
2015-05-31 13:21:48	meh	thanks
2015-05-31 13:22:15	meh	tomaka, will calling stop clear up the buffer? if for whatever reason the audio goes out of sync
2015-05-31 13:22:24	tomaka	no, IIRC it just pauses
2015-05-31 13:22:29	meh	snab
2015-05-31 13:22:40	tomaka	if you want to stop completely, just destroy the Voice
2015-05-31 13:23:02	meh	sounds good, thanks
2015-05-31 13:24:03	tomaka	note that all behaviors aren't exactly defined
2015-05-31 13:24:14	tomaka	I mean, they are defined but can be different for each platform
2015-05-31 13:24:24	tomaka	I haven't handled these yet

2015-05-31 13:24:49	tomaka	for example if you have an underflow (you didn't feed enough data), or whether the pause happens immediatly or at the end of the buffer
2015-05-31 13:25:01	tomaka	I'm not too sure what happens in these cases
2015-05-31 13:25:01	scape	is there a conrod/elmesque example where an image combined with a widget?
2015-05-31 13:25:15	meh	tomaka, guess I'll find out :D
2015-05-31 13:27:38	meh	I'm not exactly sure of what I'm doing anyway, never wrote a game and know nothing of video/audio playing
2015-05-31 13:28:05	meh	but hey, at least I got the video playing synced for now

2015-05-31 15:57:37	rAad	How can I get the vertex color to come through. Ultimately I'd like a system where there is a tileset (think a roguelike) and you can switch the background color, foreground color and the tile. i.e. a blue @ on a yellow background
2015-05-31 15:58:12	XMPPwocky	rAad: what do you mean, vertex color coming through

2015-05-31 16:02:46	rAad	I'm sure I'm using the wrong terminology. It would be the yellow background in my little example. I've got 2 trangles forming a square ("tile" for a roguelike) and a color defined for each vertex. This forms the background color. Then I'd like to apply a tile from my tileset on top and color the tile (the blue @ in the example).

2015-05-31 16:06:11	tomaka	If I understand correctly, you need vertex attributes for both the texture coordinates and the color
2015-05-31 16:06:26	tomaka	in your vertex shader you just pass the values through, so that the fragment shader gets them
2015-05-31 16:06:46	tomaka	and in the fragment shader, you load the color of the texture and do the blending manually
2015-05-31 16:07:09	tomaka	with mix(tex_color.rgb, color.rgb, tex_color.a) I guess
2015-05-31 16:07:30	tomaka	or tex_color.rgb * tex_color.a + color.rgb * (1 - tex_color.a) more explicitely

2015-05-31 20:29:49	XMPPwocky	additionally, you can use a geometry shader to have one vertex map to a full quad
